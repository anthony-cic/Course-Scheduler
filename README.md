# Course-Scheduler

This repository includes an implementation of a course scheduler GUI that allows the user to save entries into an SQL database. There is functionality for both a student and an admin. 

The student portion allows the user to schedule courses, check courses, and display courses. While the admin side of the GUI allows the user to add new semester, courses, and students. It also subsequently allows an admin to drop a semester, course, or student. 

There are 2 files associated with the repository that allow the user to zip and run on Apache Netbeans. Dependencies include java sql and creating a server neccesary to run the database. 

CourseSchedulerDBAnthonyabc6181 contains a zip file for the database items, while CourseSchedulerAnthonyabc6181 contains all of the java and coding side of things. By following the directory CourseSchedulerAnthonyabc6181 > src, all .java files can be found. 


Below are some pictures of the GUI in action:
